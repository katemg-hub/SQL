# For this project, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in order to reveal information about a digital media store using SQLite Studio.

# Create a table that shows album titles and associated artist names.
SELECT Title, Name AS Artist
FROM albums
JOIN artists
ON albums.ArtistId=artists.ArtistId;

# Determine what media type each track is.
SELECT t.Name AS TrackName, mt.Name AS MediaType
FROM tracks t
LEFT JOIN media_types mt
ON t.MediaTypeId=mt.MediaTypeId;

# Determine what genre each track is.
SELECT t.Name AS TrackName, g.Name AS Genre
FROM tracks t
LEFT JOIN genres g
ON t.GenreId=g.GenreId;

# Show the average invoice total rounded to two decimal places per billing country.
SELECT BillingCountry, ROUND(AVG(Total), 2) AS Average
