# For this project, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in order to reveal information about a digital media store using SQLite Studio.

#1. Create a table that shows album titles and associated artist names.
SELECT Title, Name AS Artist
FROM albums
JOIN artists
ON albums.ArtistId=artists.ArtistId;

#2. Determine what media type each track is.
SELECT t.Name AS TrackName, mt.Name AS MediaType
FROM tracks t
LEFT JOIN media_types mt
ON t.MediaTypeId=mt.MediaTypeId;

#3. Determine what genre each track is.
SELECT t.Name AS TrackName, g.Name AS Genre
FROM tracks t
LEFT JOIN genres g
ON t.GenreId=g.GenreId;

#4. Show the average invoice total rounded to two decimal places per billing country.
SELECT BillingCountry, ROUND(AVG(Total), 2) AS Average
FROM invoices
GROUP BY BillingCountry;

#5. Display sales support agent staff by name.
SELECT LastName, FirstName
FROM employees
WHERE title='Sales Support Agent';

#6. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.
SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country
FROM customers
WHERE country <> 'USA';

#7. Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country
FROM customers
WHERE country = 'Brazil';

#8. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, inv.InvoiceId, inv.InvoiceDate, inv.BillingCountry
FROM customers cust
LEFT JOIN invoices inv
ON cust.CustomerId=inv.CustomerId
WHERE cust.Country = 'Brazil';

#9. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry
FROM invoices;

#10. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
SELECT emp.LastName, emp.FirstName, inv.InvoiceId
FROM customers cust
JOIN invoices inv
ON cust.CustomerId=inv.CustomerId
JOIN employees emp
ON cust.SupportRepID=emp.EmployeeId;

#11. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
SELECT inv.Total, cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, cust.Country, emp.FirstName, emp.LastName
FROM customers cust
JOIN invoices inv
ON cust.CustomerId=inv.CustomerId
JOIN employees emp
ON cust.SupportRepID=emp.EmployeeId;

#12. How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

#13. What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT ROUND(SUM(Total), 2) AS TotalSales, InvoiceDate
FROM invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '%2009%';

#14. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT trks.Name AS TrackName, inv_i.InvoiceLineID
FROM tracks trks
JOIN invoice_items inv_i
ON trks.TrackId=inv_i.TrackId;

#15. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT trks.Name AS TrackName, art.Name AS ArtistName, inv_i.InvoiceLineID
FROM albums alb
JOIN artists art
ON alb.ArtistId=art.ArtistId
JOIN tracks trks
ON alb.AlbumId=trks.AlbumId
JOIN invoice_items inv_i
ON trks.TrackId=inv_i.TrackId;

#16. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.
SELECT trks.Name AS TrackName, alb.Title AS AlbumTitle, mt.Name AS MediaType, g.Name AS Genre
FROM tracks trks
JOIN albums alb
ON alb.AlbumId=trks.AlbumId
JOIN media_types mt
ON mt.MediaTypeId=trks.MediaTypeId
JOIN genres g
ON g.GenreId=trks.GenreId;

#17. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.
SELECT ROUND(SUM(inv.Total), 2) AS TotalSales, emp.LastName, emp.FirstName
FROM invoices inv
JOIN customers cust
ON cust.CustomerId=inv.CustomerId
JOIN employees emp
ON cust.SupportRepID=emp.EmployeeId
GROUP BY emp.LastName;

#18. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
SELECT ROUND(SUM(inv.Total), 2) AS TotalSales, emp.LastName, emp.FirstName
FROM invoices inv
JOIN customers cust
ON cust.CustomerId=inv.CustomerId
JOIN employees emp
ON cust.SupportRepID=emp.EmployeeId
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '%2009%'
GROUP BY emp.LastName
ORDER BY TotalSales desc
LIMIT 1;
